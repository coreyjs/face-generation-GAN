# face-generation-GAN
A GAN to generate human faces.



# Face Generation

In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

### Get the Data

You'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train your adversarial networks.

This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) you've been working with, and so, you should prepare to define deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. It is suggested that you utilize a GPU for training.

### Pre-processed Data

Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. Some sample data is show below.

This is a zip file that you'll need to extract in the home directory of this notebook for further loading and processing. After extracting the data, you should be left with a directory of data `processed_celeba_small/`


```python
# can comment out after executing
!unzip processed_celeba_small.zip
```

    'unzip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.

## Visualize the CelebA Data

The [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations. Since you're going to be generating faces, you won't need the annotations, you'll only need the images. Note that these are color images with [3 color channels (RGB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image)#RGB_Images) each.

### Pre-process and Load the Data

Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. This *pre-processed* dataset is a smaller subset of the very large CelebA data.

> There are a few other steps that you'll need to **transform** this data and create a **DataLoader**.

#### Exercise: Complete the following `get_dataloader` function, such that it satisfies these requirements:

* Your images should be square, Tensor images of size `image_size x image_size` in the x and y dimension.
* Your function should return a DataLoader that shuffles and batches these Tensor images.

#### ImageFolder

To create a dataset given a directory of images, it's recommended that you use PyTorch's [ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder) wrapper, with a root directory `processed_celeba_small/` and data transformation passed in.


```python
# necessary imports
import torch
import os
from torchvision import datasets
from torchvision import transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
```


```python
def get_dataloader(batch_size, image_size, data_dir='processed_celeba_small/') -> DataLoader:
    """
    Batch the neural network data using DataLoader
    :param batch_size: The size of each batch; the number of images in a batch
    :param img_size: The square size of the image data (x, y)
    :param data_dir: Directory where image data is located
    :return: DataLoader with batched data
    """
    
    # TODO: Implement function and return a dataloader
    
    # resize and normalize the images (variation of code found in CycleGAN notebook)
    t = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(image_size),
        transforms.ToTensor()
    ])
    
    dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(data_dir, transform=t)
    
    loader = DataLoader(
        dataset=dataset,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        shuffle=True
    )
    
    return loader
```

## Create a DataLoader

#### Exercise: Create a DataLoader `celeba_train_loader` with appropriate hyperparameters.

Call the above function and create a dataloader to view images. 
* You can decide on any reasonable `batch_size` parameter
* Your `image_size` **must be** `32`. Resizing the data to a smaller size will make for faster training, while still creating convincing images of faces!


```python
# Define function hyperparameters
batch_size = 128
img_size = 32

"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL THAT IS BELOW THIS LINE
"""
# Call your function and get a dataloader
celeba_train_loader = get_dataloader(batch_size, img_size)

```

Next, you can view some images! You should seen square images of somewhat-centered faces.

Note: You'll need to convert the Tensor images into a NumPy type and transpose the dimensions to correctly display an image, suggested `imshow` code is below, but it may not be perfect.


```python
# helper display function
def imshow(img):
    npimg = img.numpy()
    plt.imshow(np.transpose(npimg, (1, 2, 0)))

"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL THAT IS BELOW THIS LINE
"""
# obtain one batch of training images
dataiter = iter(celeba_train_loader)
images, _ = dataiter.next() # _ for no labels

# plot the images in the batch, along with the corresponding labels
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 4))
plot_size=20
for idx in np.arange(plot_size):
    ax = fig.add_subplot(2, plot_size/2, idx+1, xticks=[], yticks=[])
    imshow(images[idx])
```

#### Exercise: Pre-process your image data and scale it to a pixel range of -1 to 1

You need to do a bit of pre-processing; you know that the output of a `tanh` activated generator will contain pixel values in a range from -1 to 1, and so, we need to rescale our training images to a range of -1 to 1. (Right now, they are in a range from 0-1.)


```python
# TODO: Complete the scale function
def scale(x, feature_range=(-1, 1)):
    ''' Scale takes in an image x and returns that image, scaled
       with a feature_range of pixel values from -1 to 1. 
       This function assumes that the input x is already scaled from 0-1.'''
    # assume x is scaled to (0, 1)
    # scale to feature_range and return scaled x
    
    # unpack tuple
    min, max = feature_range
    
    x = x * (max - min) + min
    
    return x

```


```python
"""
DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS CELL THAT IS BELOW THIS LINE
"""
# check scaled range
# should be close to -1 to 1
img = images[0]

print('Orig Min: ', img.min())
print('Orig Max: ', img.max())

scaled_img = scale(img)

print('Min: ', scaled_img.min())
print('Max: ', scaled_img.max())
```

    Orig Min:  tensor(0.0784)
    Orig Max:  tensor(1.)
    Min:  tensor(-0.8431)
    Max:  tensor(1.)

# Define the Model

A GAN is comprised of two adversarial networks, a discriminator and a generator.

## Discriminator

Your first task will be to define the discriminator. This is a convolutional classifier like you've built before, only without any maxpooling layers. To deal with this complex data, it's suggested you use a deep network with **normalization**. You are also allowed to create any helper functions that may be useful.

#### Exercise: Complete the Discriminator class
* The inputs to the discriminator are 32x32x3 tensor images
* The output should be a single value that will indicate whether a given image is real or fake

## Generator

The generator should upsample an input and generate a *new* image of the same size as our training data `32x32x3`. This should be mostly transpose convolutional layers with normalization applied to the outputs.

#### Exercise: Complete the Generator class
* The inputs to the generator are vectors of some length `z_size`
* The output should be a image of shape `32x32x3`

## Initialize the weights of your networks

To help your models converge, you should initialize the weights of the convolutional and linear layers in your model. From reading the [original DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf), they say:
> All weights were initialized from a zero-centered Normal distribution with standard deviation 0.02.

So, your next task will be to define a weight initialization function that does just this!

You can refer back to the lesson on weight initialization or even consult existing model code, such as that from [the `networks.py` file in CycleGAN Github repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/models/networks.py) to help you complete this function.

#### Exercise: Complete the weight initialization function

* This should initialize only **convolutional** and **linear** layers
* Initialize the weights to a normal distribution, centered around 0, with a standard deviation of 0.02.
* The bias terms, if they exist, may be left alone or set to 0.


```python
def weights_init_normal(m):
    """
    Applies initial weights to certain layers in a model .
    The weights are taken from a normal distribution 
    with mean = 0, std dev = 0.02.
    :param m: A module or layer in a network    
    """
    # classname will be something like:
    # `Conv`, `BatchNorm2d`, `Linear`, etc.
    classname = m.__class__.__name__
    # referenced from https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/models/networks.py
    if hasattr(m, 'weight') and (classname.find('Conv') != -1 or classname.find('Linear') != -1):
        m.weight.data.normal_(0.0, 0.02)
    
        if hasattr(m, 'bias') and m.bias is not None:
            m.bias.data.zero_()

## Discriminator and Generator Losses

Now we need to calculate the losses for both types of adversarial networks.

### Discriminator Losses

> * For the discriminator, the total loss is the sum of the losses for real and fake images, `d_loss = d_real_loss + d_fake_loss`. 
* Remember that we want the discriminator to output 1 for real images and 0 for fake images, so we need to set up the losses to reflect that.


### Generator Loss

The generator loss will look similar only with flipped labels. The generator's goal is to get the discriminator to *think* its generated images are *real*.

#### Exercise: Complete real and fake loss functions

**You may choose to use either cross entropy or a least squares error loss to complete the following `real_loss` and `fake_loss` functions.**


```python
def real_loss(D_out):
    '''Calculates how close discriminator outputs are to being real.
       param, D_out: discriminator logits
       return: real loss'''
    batch_size = D_out.size(0)
    labels = torch.ones(batch_size)
    if train_on_gpu:
        labels = labels.cuda()
    
    # binary cross entropy loss with logits loss
    criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
    
    loss = criterion(D_out.squeeze(), labels)
    
    return loss

def fake_loss(D_out):
    '''Calculates how close discriminator outputs are to being fake.
       param, D_out: discriminator logits
       return: fake loss'''
    batch_size = D_out.size(0)
    labels = torch.zeros(batch_size)
    
    if train_on_gpu:
        labels = labels.cuda()
    criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
    loss = criterion(D_out.squeeze(), labels)
    return loss
```

## Optimizers

#### Exercise: Define optimizers for your Discriminator (D) and Generator (G)

Define optimizers for your models with appropriate hyperparameters.


```python
import torch.optim as optim

lr = 0.0002 #0.0002
beta1 = 0.5
beta2 = 0.999

# Create optimizers for the discriminator D and generator G
d_optimizer = optim.Adam(D.parameters(), lr, [beta1, beta2])
g_optimizer = optim.Adam(G.parameters(), lr, [beta1, beta2])
```

---
## Training

Training will involve alternating between training the discriminator and the generator. You'll use your functions `real_loss` and `fake_loss` to help you calculate the discriminator losses.

* You should train the discriminator by alternating on real and fake images
* Then the generator, which tries to trick the discriminator and should have an opposing loss function


#### Saving Samples

You've been given some code to print out some loss statistics and save some generated "fake" samples.

#### Exercise: Complete the training function

Keep in mind that, if you've moved your models to GPU, you'll also have to move any model inputs to GPU.


```python
def train(D, G, n_epochs, print_every=50):
    '''Trains adversarial networks for some number of epochs
       param, D: the discriminator network
       param, G: the generator network
       param, n_epochs: number of epochs to train for
       param, print_every: when to print and record the models' losses
       return: D and G losses'''
    
    # move models to GPU
    if train_on_gpu:

## Generator samples from training

View samples of images from the generator, and answer a question about the strengths and weaknesses of your trained models.


```python
# helper function for viewing a list of passed in sample images
def view_samples(epoch, samples):
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,4), nrows=2, ncols=8, sharey=True, sharex=True)
    for ax, img in zip(axes.flatten(), samples[epoch]):
        img = img.detach().cpu().numpy()
        img = np.transpose(img, (1, 2, 0))
        img = ((img + 1)*255 / (2)).astype(np.uint8)
        ax.xaxis.set_visible(False)
        ax.yaxis.set_visible(False)
        im = ax.imshow(img.reshape((32,32,3)))
```


```python
# Load samples from generator, taken while training
with open('train_samples.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    samples = pkl.load(f)
```


```python
_ = view_samples(-1, samples)
```

### Question: What do you notice about your generated samples and how might you improve this model?
When you answer this question, consider the following factors:
* The dataset is biased; it is made of "celebrity" faces that are mostly white
* Model size; larger models have the opportunity to learn more features in a data feature space
* Optimization strategy; optimizers and number of epochs affect your final result


**Answer:** 

Initially, I ran this network for 10 epochs.  I was able to generate face like objects (eyes, mouth, nose, hair) but the images were slightly disfigured.  I then ran this network for 30 epochs, and achieved the results above.  Here we can see clear human faces, with very little disfiguration or warping.  One thing to notice, the sample output all appears to be female in nature.  This might indicate a problem in the training.

As mentioned above, the data does seem to be biases as we have very little representation of black and asian races of both male and female.  Also the training data does not have much in the way of glasses, hats and types of facial hair, religious headware, etc.  My achieved results are quite indicitive of the data set itself.  Lots of white generated faces.

Hiar color is another factor that has a pretty slim representation in the data.  There are a few outliers that have hair that is not dark/blonde.  Most of our generated faces have a hair color that falls into this region.
